# Python Console Beginners Puzzle 3
### Lets do some console app puzzles. Most beginners start off writing console apps, so it is a good way to make sure we cover the basics.

## Puzzles
In main.py, I have commented out some starting code for these puzzles. <br />
Write your code in these sections and uncomment them. <br />
I have provided some examples of similar functions to what each puzzle is asking for. Learn to read the code and modify it. <br />

At the very bottom, I have listed the functions. Comment and uncomment them, to run them one at a time.

```
# Run the puzzles

    example_a()
    # puzzle_a()

    example_b()
    # puzzle_b()

    example_c()
    # puzzle_c()
```


### A - Maths Stuff
Write a program that asks the user to input two numbers <br />
Add the numbers together and display the result <br />
Subtract the second number from the first number and show the result <br />
Multiply the two numbers together and show the result <br />
Divide the first number by the second number and get a fraction like 1.666 <br />
Divide the first number by the second number. Show the answer - whole number AND the REMAINDER < br/>


### B - Money
Decimal is usually used for money, not float. It's more accurate. <br />
In python, you need to import Decimal to use it, at the very top of the page: < br/>
from decimal import Decimal <br />
Write a program that asks for donations to a charity <br />
Get the user's donation amount as a decimal <br />
Elon Musk will match the amount the user enters <br />
Output the user's donation amount, and the total donation after Elon matches it. <br />


### C - Death and Taxes
Write a Tax Department program that asks the user to enter their yearly salary <br />
Randomly generate a percentage between 30% and 100% to tax them <br />
Calculate what they will pay in tax <br />
The tax department works using whole numbers, so if they enter a floating point number round it up to a whole number. <br />
Tell them the bad news. Let them know the tax percentage they are paying and how much they will pay in tax. <br />


# Good Luck!
